"Bus and Demand response/Paratransit in these tables refer to a mode of service, not to a specific vehicle type. Demand responsive service, defined as roadway service directly from an origin to a destination determined by the rider and not following a fixed-route, is usually provided by vans, small buses and in a limited number of cases by large buses. Bus service is a variety of roadway services that share the characteristic of being entirely or partially fixed routes.
